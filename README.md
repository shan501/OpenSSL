# OpenSSL
A simple guide to OpenSSL.
OpenSSL allows you to create SSL certificates within your network without a certfied Certificate Authority.
I used a tutorial made by theurbanpenguin to make this guide.This guide is bassically a summary of his tutorial.If anything is unclear here please check out his amazing video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8OpUcHzTeg&t=22s

## Basic Introduction
Certificates are used for encrypted communications between devices.SSL are commonly used for encrypting communications on the web but it can also be used with LAN.Many organizations would use a self signed Certifcate Authority to reduce overhead and increase efficency over using a certified third-party Certificate Authority.In this tutorial i will be creating a root Certificate Authority , an Intermediate Certificate Authority , and Servers.
